deltascope
===========

This package is designed to quantify biological structures in 3D image data. 

Features
+++++++++

- Compare sets of 3D biological images to identify differences
- Automatically align the structure in the image to correct for variation introduced during mounting and imaging 
- Generate descriptive graphs that quantify both the average and variation of the data
- Use machine learning techniques to classify samples and identify regions of statistically significant difference
